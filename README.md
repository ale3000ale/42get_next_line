### Mandatory
Make a program that given a file descriptor (FD) reads one line at a time and with a buffer of size chosen during the compilation phase.

### Bonus

The program can work with more FDs.

## Tips and tricks

If you wont do Bonus, just make a program that already works for many FDs, you can  make a matrix of buffers (one row for one FD) or you can create a list (one node fore one FD)
